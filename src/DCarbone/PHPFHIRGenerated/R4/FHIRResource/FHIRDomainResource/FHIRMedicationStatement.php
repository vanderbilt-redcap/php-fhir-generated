/**
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient. A
 * MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication
 * now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in
 * the future. The source of this information can be the patient, significant other
 * (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician. A common scenario where
 * this information is captured is during the history taking process during a
 * patient visit or stay. The medication information may come from sources such as
 * the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle, or from a list of medications
 * the patient, clinician or other party maintains. The primary difference between
 * a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication
 * administration has complete administration information and is based on actual
 * administration information from the person who administered the medication. A
 * medication statement is often, if not always, less specific. There is no
 * required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know
 * that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details
 * such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or
 * missing or less precise. As stated earlier, the medication statement information
 * may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
 * medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. Medication
 * administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
 * If the element is present, it must have either a \@value, an \@id, or extensions
